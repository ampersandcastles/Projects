npm start vs npm dev

both keywords from scripts

npm start
    - When running the npm start command from the root directory of the project, node will look for a 'scripts' object in the package.json file. Once found with the key 'start', it will run the command that is specified as its value

npm dev 
    - indicates that we're running the project in developtment mode and we're using 'nodemon' to do so
    - nodemon allows for dynamic changes in the server.

node_modules
    - packages that npm installs that allow our application and all of its dependencies to run properly

package-lock.json
    - locks in the version of the packages that we're using.
    - version control system that acts as a failsafe.

Express
    -lightweight web application framework used to help organize our application into a MVC archetecture within our server.
        -MVC: Model View Controller
    -Not a model view controller framework by itself. Still need to use our own ORM (Object-relational mapping) library.
