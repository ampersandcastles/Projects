- useState always accepts two values:
  the state variable that's based upon the initial value we pass into it - in this case, undefined

  - a function defined as setSessionToken. setSessionToken is our means of changing the value of our state variable.

  - naming convention for state variable is always what our state variable is called and then 'set'<variable>

Naming conventions for components begin with capital letter.
