# Red Badge module notes

ClassComponentDemo.js file
: Had to put inside the /src folder as it couldn't be accessed outside of it.

- Notes on props
  - not the same as state
  - are received from above from a 'parent' component
  - are immutable
  - are properties, a way to configure a component
  - can think of them like parameters to a function
